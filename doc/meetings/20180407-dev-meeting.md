ellaismer - Today at 12:02 PM
@here Our dev meeting this week starts now! If you have any agenda you want to discuss, please raise your voice!

From development side, I'm still busy getting the final bits of multi-geth done. So I don't have many things to discuss. (Or if you have any questions related to multi-geth, please feel free to ask!)
I think @Towd might have something to discuss related to new Community Fund. If he/she's not there, we might have a really short meeting this week. :laughing:
DeSVaR - Today at 12:03 PM
I would like to talk about yesteray giveaway and possible future ones(edited)
ellaismer - Today at 12:04 PM
Sure! :smiley:
DeSVaR - Today at 12:05 PM
I need 10ish minutes to get to PC
limax - Today at 12:05 PM
also @terra-pescado can share his ideas (i think)(edited)
Kimi Sian-Yu Chen - Today at 12:07 PM
arrived :yum:
Towd - Today at 12:09 PM
I am still waiting for a response from the old community fund guys.  I think things are not looking too promising.  They really don't seem to even want to talk to me now that I'm trying to pin them down on a commitment to sign over funds.  Last week they were at least making demands for refunds, etc.  So, there it is.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:10 PM
JayGatsbys: :eyes:
Towd - Today at 12:10 PM
I have 5 signees, but I still would like to get someone from the web development group and the Telegram to commit to the new Community Fund Wallet.
I'm also open to anyone else as long as we get a diverse group of signers.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:10 PM
JayGatsbys: Yes
JayGatsbys: Everyone here? AI?(edited)
limax - Today at 12:11 PM
@Towd I'll join one of the missing groups
Towd - Today at 12:12 PM
Great, thanks Limax.
limax - Today at 12:12 PM
no problem
Nulligun - Today at 12:13 PM
How many of the signers will be anonymous?
ellaismer - Today at 12:13 PM
@Towd And have we asked whether all signers is okay to either be non-anonymous or has been in the Ellaism community for a long time?
Towd - Today at 12:14 PM
I have not specified that.
Is that something we want to do?
ellaismer - Today at 12:14 PM
Personally I would strongly suggest we do that. Otherwise we may face the same problem as the old one..
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:15 PM
JayGatsbys (in reply to @ellaismer): Yep
JayGatsbys: Ellaismer will whyral be any use to us?
ellaismer - Today at 12:16 PM
JayGatsbys: Whyral is unrelated to Ellaism. I've asked @sc0rp1on not to promote it in Ellaism community.
Towd - Today at 12:16 PM
Okay, if people wish to remain anonymous, I'll look into length of time that they have been supporting the project.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:17 PM
JayGatsbys (in reply to @ellaismer): Oh ok
ellaismer - Today at 12:17 PM
I would recommend at least 4-5 months if people wish to remain anonymous. And @Towd how many people is anonymous now?
DeSVaR - Today at 12:18 PM
I would like to know if its necessary to make new wallet to be a signee. And if it needs to be I will share my bio
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:18 PM
JayGatsbys: Anonymous for the public can stay yes?
DeSVaR - Today at 12:19 PM
I mean, if we need names
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:19 PM
JayGatsbys: Only the team needs to know real names(edited)
ellaismer - Today at 12:20 PM
@DeSVaR Yes. If we don't get the old wallet back on time, we'll just start a new wallet.
Towd - Today at 12:20 PM
@ellaismer Sounds good.  I think it will not be a problem, I'll just doublecheck the volunteers.
ellaismer - Today at 12:20 PM
@Towd Great!
Aurocheen - Today at 12:21 PM
Im still up for donating 300 for the contest if we start the new one as well
DeSVaR - Today at 12:21 PM
@ellaismer I mean if it's recommended that i make a new wallet for signing my part if I become signee.
Towd - Today at 12:21 PM
@ellaismer Right now, everyone on the list is Anonymous as far as I know.  But some people may be willing to put their name with their signatures, I will check.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:22 PM
JayGatsbys: Haha
Towd - Today at 12:22 PM
My only other business is exchanges.  Last week it was suggested we apply to NovaExchange as another small to medium sized exchange.  I found out however that they have shut down new member registrations and I presume new coin listings as well.  So instead I've put in an application at Yobit.  They offer tiered application fees with I assume varying odds of acceptance, but one of the tiers is "free".  So we'll see.  Application response time is about a week.
Jay, you should be our signee to represent the Telegram community.  You've been here long enough to remain anonymous.  :smile:
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:23 PM
JayGatsbys: Nove didnt close
JayGatsbys: They are not that bad(edited)
Towd - Today at 12:23 PM
They are not closed, but they are not doing new signups.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:23 PM
JayGatsbys: Not yet
JayGatsbys: A new team just took over
Towd - Today at 12:23 PM
When they re-open, I'll apply.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:24 PM
JayGatsbys: Yea
Towd - Today at 12:26 PM
That is all my updates from Com-Fund and Exchanges.
limax - Today at 12:26 PM
I have few things to put here
first, do we have any chance to recover old Twitter account?
there are any possible actions that we can take?
ellaismer - Today at 12:27 PM
@Towd And regarding Telegram group, we may want to ask @AI if haven't.
Towd - Today at 12:27 PM
@ellaismer  Will do.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:28 PM
JayGatsbys (in reply to @ellaismer): Yes AI would do he told me(edited)
ellaismer - Today at 12:28 PM
@limax I don't think Twitter cares about those. So I think our chance to recover that is slim.
limax - Today at 12:29 PM
@Towd we can use more members from one group, so from telegram we can have 2
ellaismer - Today at 12:29 PM
(And we still need more members to manage the @EllaismProject handle. See #welcome for details.)
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:29 PM
JayGatsbys (in reply to @limax): Please try
limax - Today at 12:30 PM
if we cannot recover old account we need to make an effort and update links on different websites
ellaismer - Today at 12:31 PM
It's already updated in most of the places. CMC has correct informations AFAICT, and most other websites only link to ellaism.org.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:31 PM
JayGatsbys: Maybe if Ellaismer would ask Twitter :cowboy:(edited)
limax - Today at 12:32 PM
I think we need the marketing working group
ellaismer - Today at 12:34 PM
@limax Is this related to social networks? If so, let's name it social networks working group. I just think marketing is too vague, but that's just a small grumble.  :laughing:
limax - Today at 12:35 PM
the name is not important for me, the important thing is to have something to guide different actions
like the one started by @DeSVaR
and also a place where to comment the actions and efforts in that direction
thanks @ellaismer
ellaismer - Today at 12:37 PM
@limax Either way, I created both. :laughing: 
There's #marketing under umbrella, and the #social-networks working group.
Towd - Today at 12:38 PM
I think #marketing will be a nice place to dump community artwork to we don't spam up #ideas.  So, it'll be nice to have in that sense.
limax - Today at 12:39 PM
@Towd good idea
ellaismer - Today at 12:40 PM
And I think it's time we collect all working group names and put it on the Team page in the website. I think the simplest approach is that if you think you're a leader of a working group, you simply post a message there (saying you should be considered to be included in the Team page), and include a short bio. And just like before, we have the good will assumption -- if you don't get downvotes, it's most likely a yes, otherwise we consider it case-by-case.
(And please write a good bio of yourself when you do!)

How does everyone think about this?(edited)
limax - Today at 12:40 PM
:smile:
I was close to discuss about the same thing
DeSVaR - Today at 12:41 PM
About twitter account there is chance to close it. In Germany they/we have Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz (Network Enforcement Act) . And the laws there are strong enough to force twitter to closse account.
I can take over that action, but we need to agree
limax - Today at 12:42 PM
also if you do this please use an official email account
@ellaismer can help with this
ellaismer - Today at 12:42 PM
@DeSVaR Sure! I have no objection if you take over.
And if you don't have an email address @ellaism.com already, please PM me and I'll help you to set up.
limax - Today at 12:43 PM
Can be a small chance to recover the account if the action will start from an official account
I mean we can prove that is hurting this project by using the name, the logo and so
Towd - Today at 12:45 PM
No, I think it is a good idea to close it down.  I had been using it as one of my communication lines to the old Com-Fund guys (CountCryptula), but with that drying up I no longer need it.  And the @ellaismcoin account continues to confuse people to this day.
limax - Today at 12:46 PM
ok, @DeSVaR can you start this process?
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:47 PM
JayGatsbys: AI asked me in dm if it maybe is a good idea to get a tip bot in this tg chat or is that to silly? Just wanted to ask you guys.
DeSVaR - Today at 12:47 PM
Yes, i will take over. Shall I go towards account deletion or recover?
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:47 PM
JayGatsbys: Maybe Ellaism will be to serious for this so i dont know
ellaismer - Today at 12:47 PM
Ah, sorry. Regarding tip bot I just didn't have the time to get it done. It's on the list.
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:48 PM
JayGatsbys: Oh really
Towd - Today at 12:48 PM
@DeSVaR  I would go for recovery first.
limax - Today at 12:48 PM
@DeSVaR I still think we shold try to recover first by exposing the situation
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:49 PM
JayGatsbys: Ok haha i know some groups that are tipping a lot. Should get them over to Ellaism
almuntje (in reply to JayGatsbys): Yes, tipbot is opensource
limax - Today at 12:50 PM
@DeSVaR You can use the debriefing from the website also, I think
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:50 PM
JayGatsbys: Yea, Ellaismer will fix it
JayGatsbys (in reply to almuntje): Good you are here
almuntje (in reply to JayGatsbys): 4pm is 6pm where I live. Not a good time for me
almuntje: Anyway
limax - Today at 12:52 PM
regarding the website I think @CryptoFern is busy in this period and the presentation part will be delayed
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:52 PM
almuntje: Jay, will you be a signee?
almuntje: Or what are your thoughts about it
JayGatsbys (in reply to almuntje): Well talk Dm
limax - Today at 12:53 PM
I'll start the wiki part next week and I'll ask for volunteers in #website-development
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:53 PM
almuntje (in reply to JayGatsbys): :ok_hand:
DeSVaR - Today at 12:54 PM
OK, I will start tomorrow with gathering all information and evidence.
limax - Today at 12:55 PM
@Towd regarding your campaign do we still wait?
Towd - Today at 12:55 PM
Without funds. I'm putting it on hold.  I got too much on my plate anyway.
If you want to lead it, I'll help.
limax - Today at 12:56 PM
I'll look over it and we can discuss
Towd - Today at 12:56 PM
Otherwise, let's revisit it in a week.  I'm pretty fried this week.
These old comfund guys are infuriating to be honest.  :stuck_out_tongue:
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:57 PM
JayGatsbys: Yes to say the least
limax - Today at 12:58 PM
We will get more donations, we just need a new account to collect I think
ellaismer - Today at 12:59 PM
(If it's really too difficult, I'd say let's just get over with it and focus on setting up the new funds.)
Al - Today at 12:59 PM
@ellaismer What will be the role of Ellaism at Ethereum social?
EllagramBOT - Today at 12:59 PM
JayGatsbys: They are very young i think.(edited)
Towd - Today at 1:00 PM
Yeah,  we still need our com-fund setup.  So I'm just approaching it one step at a time.  When I first brought up the marketing idea.  I had thought we'd run it in April, but I think it wont be much of an issue to push it back another week or so.  We kind of want to do it at the same time the overall market is turning and money is coming back in, IMHO.  So, I don't see a rush while we are still in a bear market.  Right now, getting our house in order should be a top priority.
EllagramBOT - Today at 1:00 PM
JayGatsbys (in reply to @Towd): Pot smoking gamers.
Towd - Today at 1:00 PM
We should be able to get the new com-fund set up this week.
ellaismer - Today at 1:01 PM
@Al That's an unrelated coin. If you ask why we accept other coins in multi-geth, it's because that's our optimal strategy and it's also what multi-geth is about. If we don't add them, they would just fork and that's not good for either party. So our rules currently for adding new Ethereum coins to multi-geth is just that the coin's developer can provide support (i.e. they can submit a PR to our multi-geth repo without major issue.)
Al - Today at 1:03 PM
@ellaismer Will it benefit Ellaism in any way?
limax - Today at 1:03 PM
We need to involve more members in the working groups
Including the telegram members
ellaismer - Today at 1:03 PM
@Al Because it's a coin with totally different visions, I don't think it benefits Ellaism directly.
DeSVaR - Today at 1:06 PM
I would like to know, what are everyones  thought about giveaways and how to approach with execution of them(edited)
ellaismer - Today at 1:09 PM
@DeSVaR I think the first major issue is where the giveaway funds come from. Once that's settled, there're many ideas to get the giveaway going such as @Towd's campaign.(edited)
limax - Today at 1:09 PM
@DeSVaR That's why I asked for #marketing / #social-networks
To discuss there before
DeSVaR - Today at 1:10 PM
Sorry I missed that
limax - Today at 1:14 PM
I think we don't have more to discuss for this week. I'm sure more discussions will be, as always, in the groups
ellaismer - Today at 1:14 PM
Great. If there's nothing else, let's close the meeting!
Last chance for everyone. @here :smiley:
Towd - Today at 1:15 PM
Sounds good!
