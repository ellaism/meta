@here It's the weekly dev meeting! I guess many of us (including me!) are enjoying the World Cup finals. So I'm not sure how many people will be here this week. No matter whether we have stuff to discuss this week, I'll be here to answer questions. :smiley:

Some development update: I'm working on a web services that allows you to compile Rust to pwasm. Once we get this, it can be integrated to the explorer, and it will be an essential part to allow us to validate wasm source code on the blockchain.

And congratulations to @Nulligun! Looks like we're about to get Trust wallet support from their sides as well! https://github.com/ellaism/trust-wallet-ios/issues/9#issuecomment-404325381

Hello all
! ç·¥â û - 07/14/2018
So the meeting?
I'm waiting.
Let me just grab some thing to eat.
Nulligun - 07/14/2018
I'm excited about the Dapp browser in the Android version of Trust Wallet.    I'm working on getting token support into Android Wallet (Lunary fork), then it will be ready to promote. 

After that I'm going to work a bit on pulling data from wiki to website like before.(edited)
I'd also like to get the Lunary fork into Fdroid repo soon.

I'm curious about https://polkadot.network/  would that allow Ellaism to interact main Eth network, or other Eth-base networks?
Oh and I think I saw a permission setting that would prevent people from posting discord invite links :smiley:
ellaismer - 07/14/2018
That's definitely possible. :smiley:
Ah @Nulligun what's the permission setting? I didn't find it anywhere.
limax - 07/14/2018
Only way to do that is to disallow link embedding for regular users
ellaismer - 07/14/2018
Done! Let's see how it goes.
Usually link embedding is a distraction so right now everyone's treated equal. But moderators can always change this settings globally or for specific channels.
Nulligun - 07/14/2018
my bad, invite link permissions are not a thing yet :frowning:
limax - 07/14/2018
@ellaismer old link to logo.png on website should be restored
There are services using that link
Nulligun - 07/14/2018
@ellaismer  is polkadot something that Ellaism could use?  If so what has to be done for it to be beneficial?
ellaismer - 07/14/2018
@Nulligun Yes. It allows some form of interchain communication.
But right now there's nothing much we can do -- Polkadot is still under development.
@limax Let me fix that.
Fixed!

Guys, it's not a big issue but we are visible. 
Andreas Antonopoulos has mentioned Ellaism in his upcoming Ethereum book. :wink:

@ellaismer  What about the meeting?
ellaismer - 07/14/2018
@! ç·¥â û Guess there's just not a lot of people there due to World Cup finals. But if you have any questions, I'll be here! :smiley:
