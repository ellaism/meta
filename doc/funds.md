# Development and Community Funds

In an effort to maintain a high level of transparency for the Ellaism Project, donated funds are held in multisignature (multisig) wallets. The multisig wallets for the development and community funds can receive inbound transactions as normal. However, to execute transactions, it requires multiple, unrelated entities to sign the transaction.

>The development and community funds are not intended to be utilized as a governance protocol. The understood purpose of these funds is to serve the community-driven goals of the Ellaism Project.

Please see below for the current signers for the development and community funds, respectively.
