<!-- TITLE: Principles -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Ellaism - A stable network with no premine and no dev fees -->

(Derived from Principles of Bitcoin)[^1]
All changes and upgrades to the protocol should strive to maintain and reinforce these Principles of Ellaism

* Monetary Policy: 280 million coins.
* No censorship: Nobody should be able to prevent valid txs from being confirmed.
* Open-Source: Ellaism source code should always be open for anyone to read, modify, copy, share.
* Permissionless: No arbitrary gatekeepers should ever prevent anybody from being part of the network (user, node, miner, etc).
* Pseudonymous: No ID should be required to own, use Ellaism.
* Fungible: All coins are equal and should be equally spendable.
* Irreversible Transactions: Confirmed blocks should be set in stone. Blockchain History should be immutable.
* No Contentious Hard Forks: Never hard fork without consensus from the whole community. Only break the existing consensus when necessary.
Many feature upgrades can be carried out without a hard fork, such as improving the performance of the EVM.
