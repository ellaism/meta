## Install Drivers

If you use Nvidia, make sure CUDA toolkit is installed. On the other hand, choose OpenCL if you have an AMD card.

## Getwork and Stratum

If you are solo mining, Geth only supports Getwork, and Parity's Stratum feature needs to be manually enabled. Make sure the endpoint is accessible from your local computer.
