<!-- TITLE: Parity -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Ellaism - A stable network with no premine and no dev fees -->

Parity is an Ethereum client, written from the ground-up for correctness-verifiability, modularisation, low-footprint and high-performance.
To this end it utilises the Rust language, a hybrid imperative/OO/functional language with an emphasis on efficiency. It is developed by Parity Technologies, a VC-funded UK-based company.
Parity aim to have all important logic 100% unit-tested, all public APIs 100% documented, all code reviewed by multiple peers and follow a pipelined 7-ish-week release cycle similar to the Rust compiler.

Parity comes with an extensive, in-built Ethereum Wallet and Dapp environment. It includes:

* Accounts and address-book.
* Key creation, importing and exporting.
* Web3 √êapp browser.
* Hardware and electronic cold-wallet support.
* Name registry support.
* Contract development, deployment and interaction environment.
