## Introduction

OpenAlias allows you to use domain style addressing. It's easier to remember outdoordevs.com than it is to remember 0xF08d00694Ff9aDbE37960030fE622EdEa35Eb48F.  You can tie a domain name to any cryptocurrency address with OpenAlias.

The standard was created and is currently maintained by the [Monero dev team](https://openalias.org).

## How to do it

If you have your own domain name you can create OpenAlias records for it in a few easy steps.

1. [Make sure your domain name has DNSSec enabled](/tutorials/openalias-setup-domain).
2. [Create your OpenAlias records](/tutorials/openalias-create-record).
3. [Test your OpenAlias records](https://oat.outdoordevs.com/).

## Current Issues

If you setup OpenAlias records now, you should consider yourself a pre-early adopter.  These are a few of the problems you might encounter.

1. DNSSec is required and it's not universal yet. 
2. Not a lot of services support it. Unless your machine is resolving against DNS servers that use DNSSec, OpenAlias is not safe to use from a browser.
3. Verifying a chain of trust is not easy and not well documented.

If you are a developer, the [Ellaism OpenAlias Rest Api](/tutorials/openalias-rest) can help with all of these problems.
