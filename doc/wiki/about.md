<!-- SUBTITLE: Ellaism - A stable network with no premine and no dev fees -->

Ellaism is an Ethereum based network  and intends to use exclusively “proof of work” to secure the blockchain.

It benefits from a zero pre-mine and has no mandatory developer fees with all support and development donated freely by the community.
We believe this makes our coin one of the most honest pure Ethereum projects, and something that is uniquely interesting as a platform for serious developers, educators, and enthusiasts.

Ellaism also has a clearly defined monetary policy, with around 280 million coins in total.
