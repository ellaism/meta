## Introduction

Ellaism is an open-source platform for decentralized applications. Ellaism features similar capabilities as the Ethereum network, allowing for deployments of smart contracts that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Ellaism has a monetary policy which includes a mining reward of 5 ELLA per block, and a maximum supply of approximately 280,000,000 ELLA. The block reward will be reduced by 20% every 10 million blocks to allow for a long tail emission to promote continued network security.
