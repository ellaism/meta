## Introduction

Ellaism is an open-source platform for decentralized applications. Ellaism features similar capabilities as the Ethereum network, allowing for deployments of smart contracts that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. At block 2,000,000 the Ellaism network forked to enable Parity's Wasm implementation, allowing for contracts to be written in any language that can compile to WebAssembly.

Ellaism has a monetary policy which includes a mining reward of 5 ELLA per block, and a maximum supply of approximately 280,000,000 ELLA. The block reward will be reduced by 20% every 10 million blocks to allow for a long tail emission to promote continued network security.
